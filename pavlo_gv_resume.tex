				\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
				\item \textbf{Mechatronics} (Fall 2017, 2018, Spring 2019): Led instructional lab sections teaching students about event-driven programming, hierarchical state machines, sensor design, and system integration. Managed six tutors, and manufacturing of class hardware.
				\item \textbf{Sensor and Sensing Technology} (Winter 2018, 2019) Taught students how to implment and use resistive flex sensors, piezo electric sensors, capacitive touch sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers as part of an inertial measurements unit. Lectured on attitude estimation using complementary filters and IMU calibration.
				\item \textbf{Embedded Systems and C Programming} (Spring \& Summer 2018, Summer 2019) Topics included: basic syntax, pointers, memory allocation, hardware interrupt sub-routines, debouncing, and basic file IO.
				\item \textbf{Microcontroller System Design} (Fall 2019) Topics included: Interrupt-driven UART, I2C, SPI, packet systems, FIR filters, interfacing with external EEPROM, encoders, an H-Bridge, and interupt-driven PID loops for controlling motor rate and position.
